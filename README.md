# Geneva Confection

## How the program works

1. The user is prompted to enter the number of tests to run

2. The user is then prompted to enter the numer of carts for each test

3. The user is then prompted for a number for each cart in each test

4. The program then outputs in order whether or not the tests will be successful or not and prompts the user to play again
